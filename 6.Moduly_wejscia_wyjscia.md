<h1>6. Input Sensors: </h1>

**Digital Input (DI) Sensors:**  

* Limit Switches  -  Detect the presence or absence of an object at a specific position.  
* Push Buttons  -  Used for manual input or to start/stop processes.  
* Proximity Sensors  -  Detect the presence or absence of an object without physical contact (inductive, capacitive, ultrasonic, etc.).  
* Photoelectric Sensors  -  Use light beams to detect objects.  
* Reed Switches  -  Detect magnetic fields, often used in proximity sensing.  

**Analog Input (AI) Sensors:**  

* Temperature Sensors (e.g., thermocouples, RTDs)  -  Measure temperature.  
* Pressure Sensors  -  Monitor pressure in pneumatic or hydraulic systems.  
* Level Sensors  -  Measure the level of liquids or solids in tanks.  
* Flow Sensors  -  Monitor the flow rate of liquids or gases.  
* Position Sensors (e.g., potentiometers)  -  Measure the position of a moving part.  

<h1>Output Devices:</h1>

**Digital Output (DO) Devices:**

* Solenoid Valves  -  Control the flow of fluids in pneumatic or hydraulic systems.    
* Relays  -  Electrically controlled switches used to activate various devices.    
* Motor Starters  -  Control the operation of electric motors.    
* Indicator Lights  -  Display the status of a process or system.    
* Alarms and Horns  -  Provide audible or visual alerts.    

**Analog Output (AO) Devices:**

* Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs)  -  Control the speed of AC motors.    
* Proportional Control Valves  -  Precisely control fluid flow or pressure.    
* Analog Meters  -  Display analog data such as voltage, current, or pressure.
**Pulse Output Devices:**

* Encoders  -  Measure the position or speed of rotating machinery.  
* Frequency Counters  -  Count pulses generated by various sensors.
