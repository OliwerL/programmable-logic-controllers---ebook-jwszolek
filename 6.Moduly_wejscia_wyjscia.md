# 1. Internal structure of a Programmable Logic Controller

## What is a PLC?

A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is a small computing device that carry out pre-programmed outputs based on inputs and a set of specific logic rules. It is used for controlling and automating various processes and machinery in industries and manufacturing environments.

## How is a PLC built?

### 1. CPU

<img src="imageskvt/CPUimg.png" alt="drawing" width="400" height="400"/>

The central processing unit (CPU), also known as the processor unit, is responsible for interpreting input signals and executing control actions based on the program stored in its memory. It communicates decisions as action signals to the output devices. It can execute millions of instructions per second, but only one instruction at a time.

The CPU in the PLC follows a repeating cycle. This circuit is important for processing instructions and controlling the operation of the PLC:

- It retrieves instructions from memory (fetching) to know how to execute the input and understand the instructions corresponding to the specific information it receives. This is also called reading from memory.

- Decoding or translating the instructions into a machine language (binary), which CPU can understand.

- Executing the instructions given.

- Writing results to memory.

CPU consists of 3 main parts:
  
- ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) is a component that performs arithmetic and numerical operations in every computer. ALU is used for addition, subtraction, division, division, comparison of two numbers, and Boolean operations. It does not directly deal with memory.
- CU (Control Unit). It controls the input and output flow. It is the part that receives instructions from the main memory, stores them, and then decodes them.
- Registers. Super fast memory location. The data and instructions being processed at runtime of cycle are stored there for quick access by the processor.

### 2. The memory unit

The memory unit stores the program that the microprocessor uses to control the system. The main types of memory used in PLCs are ROM and RAM.

- A RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that provides temporary and fast storage for data and programs actively used by the CPU. A RAM memory location can be written and read.
- ROM (Read Only Memory) is a type of computer memory that stores permanent data and instructions that cannot be easily altered or erased. It is used for essential system firmware and software, like program that allows the computer to start.

There are also different types of memory such as:

- Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM) It is a read only type of memory, but we can edit and reprogram it using ultra-violate light.
- Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). It can be electronically erased and programmed, but editing of memory is limited by several times.
- Flash EEPROMs. It is similar to EEPROM, but it can be editable for unlimited numbers of times.

### 3. Inputs and outputs module

Input and output sections are where the processor receives data from other devices and sends information to external devices. The inputs can come from switches, temperature sensors, position sensors, etc. The outputs can be sent to motors, bulbs, buzzers, solenoid valves and other devices.

### 4. Power supply

The power supply converts main AC input to low voltage DC (mostly to 12V, 5V, 3.3V DC).

<h1>3.RELAYS IN DISCRETE INPUT AND OUTPUT MODULES</h1>

<h2>Relays:<h2
             
  Relay is an electro-mechanical switch that is used to control electrical circuits by opening or closing contacts (switches) in response to an electrical signal. Relays are commonly used in to isolate and control high-power or high-voltage devices using low-power control signals.
  
**Relay main components:**

*Coil: Primary input of the relay. It is typically made of copper wire and is wound around a magnetic core.

*Contacts: The contacts are the switch-like components inside the relay that open or close when the relay is energized or de-energized. There are typically two sets of contacts in a relay: normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC).

*Armature: The armature is a movable component within the relay that is mechanically linked to the contacts. When the coil is energized, the magnetic field causes the armature to move, either opening or closing the contacts.

*Spring: The spring provides the necessary tension to return the armature to its resting position when the coil is de-energized. It ensures that the contacts return to their default state.

**Applications of Relays:**

* Controlling motors, valves, and other high-power devices in manufacturing and industrial processes.

* Used in automotive circuits for functions such as turning on headlights, controlling fans, and engaging the starter motor.

* In remote control systems for devices like garage door openers and remote-controlled toys.

* In safety systems to ensure that certain conditions are met before allowing a process to proceed, such as in safety interlock systems.

<h2>Input Modules: </h2>

**Discrete input modules** are the part of the PLC system that collects digital input signals from various sensors, switches, or other devices in the field. These signals are typically in the form of electrical voltage levels, and they represent the state of a specific parameter or condition. Discrete input modules are designed to interface with these sensors and convert their signals into a format that the PLC can understand. They are also responsible for filtering and conditioning input signals to ensure reliable and accurate detection.

**Functions of relays in input modules:**
*Isolation: Relays provide electrical isolation between the external devices and the PLC's internal circuitry. This isolation ensures that any electrical faults or surges in the field won't directly affect the PLC's sensitive electronics.

*Signal Amplification: Relays can amplify weak input signals, ensuring that even low-voltage signals from sensors can be detected reliably.

*Signal Conditioning: In some cases, relays can be used for signal conditioning, such as debouncing switch contacts or converting signals from different voltage levels or types (e.g., AC to DC).

*Input Status Indication: Relays often have LED indicators that provide visual feedback about the status of each input channel. This helps operators and technicians quickly diagnose issues in the field.

<h2>Output Modules: </h2>

**Discrete output modules** in a PLC system are responsible for sending binary control signals to various output devices, such as motors, solenoids, lights, or alarms. These modules receive commands from the PLC's program and actuate the output devices accordingly.

**Functions of relays in input modules:**

*Amplification and Isolation: Relays amplify the PLC's low-power control signals to levels suitable for driving external loads like motors or solenoids. Similarly to input modules, they provide isolation to protect the PLC from potential back EMF or voltage spikes generated by these devices.

*Switching High Currents or Voltages: Relays are particularly useful when the PLC's control voltage levels do not match the voltage requirements of the output devices. For example, if the PLC uses low-voltage logic (e.g., 24V DC) but needs to control a high-voltage motor (e.g., 240V AC), relays are used to switch the higher voltage.

*Output Status Indication: Discrete output modules with relays often include indicators to show the status of each output channel. This helps operators monitor the state of connected devices.
